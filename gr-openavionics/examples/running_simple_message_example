Getting the Demo to Run
===========================

Step 1 - Create Virtual serial ports
---------------------------
If you are not working with real hardware, you need to start three virtual serial ports.  Socat is a good option for this.  If you don't have socat, you can install with:

sudo apt-get install socat

After you have this installed, you need to start three separate instances.  Open three separate terminal tabs, and run threee instances of this command:

socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

Note the paths of each of the pairs created.  Here's an example:

john@hoover:~/src/openavionics/gr-openavionics/examples$ socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
2013/04/23 21:00:42 socat[10899] N PTY is /dev/pts/10
2013/04/23 21:00:42 socat[10899] N PTY is /dev/pts/11

So, in this case, our ports are /dev/pts/10 and /dev/pts/11.



Step 2 - Start the gnuradio flowgraph
-----------------------------
This is a simple one:

python [openavionics_folder]/gr-openavionics/examples/ahrs_gps_eis_to_fg.py

You may need to open the GRC file and change the serial devices listed to match the pairs of virtual serial ports you get from Step 1.


Step 3 - Start the emulator
-----------------------------
Before starting the emulator, look at the ports.conf file in [openavionics_folder]/ahrs_emul/python.  Change the port names to match the ports from step 1, but opposite of step 2.  For example, you would have assigned /dev/pts/10 in the gnuradio flowgraph, and then /dev/pts/11 in the ports.conf file.  This connects the two applications through the virtual serial connection.

Anyway, replace the serial ports of the first three lines with the serial connections from Step 1.

Then run the emulator:

python [openavionics_folder]/ahrs_emul/python/ahrs_emul_2.py -c [openavionics_folder]/ahrs_emul/python/ports.conf -f [openavionics_folder]/ahrs_emul/python/DEMO-20130227-094408+30.LOG --speedup 3.5

Step 4 - Start Flightgear for Display
--------------------------------------
Run this command. If you are running FlightgearMap on a tablet, replace "192.168.69.104" with the ip address of your tablet - must be on the same wireless router.
